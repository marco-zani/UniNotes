# Security in perspective
- Attacks violate one or more of the CIA properties
- Identifying which properties are violated help in
     - understanding the impact and
     - identifying which security services should be used to deploy security mechanisms for risk mitigation
- Ensuring security is a difficult task because of several issues
     - attribution
     - scale of and borderless attacks
     - growing attack surface
     - lack of collaboration among victims
- Security and privacy overlaps but are different and sometimes conflicting
- Privacy preserving techniques are relevant also from a legal point of view
     - The GDPR encapsulates a risk based approach to privacy
- Security is not purely technical, human factors play a crucial role
     - Hence the importance of security awareness and security training to improve the security posture

# Passwords and authentication
- Authentication amounts to verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system
- Here we focused on user authentication
- Passwords are one of the most widespread and accepted method for user authentication despite their shortcomings
- Adequate security mechanisms should be put in place to protect stored passwords
     - Hashing, salting, access control
- Authentication is only one phase of the identity management lifecycle
     - Also other phases (e.g., identity proofing) may have weaknesses
- Given the importance and difficulty of identity management, it is frequently outsourced to trusted third parties with advantages and disadvantages also from the viewpoint of security (and privacy)

# SAML
- SAML allows service providers to outsource identity management and focus on their core business
     - Reduced administration burden
     - Improved interoperability, usability, security and privacy
- SAML profiles are useful use case scenarios
     - Web SSO most widely adopted
     - SSO has increasing importance and is gaining wider and wider adoption
- SAML is ideal starting point to build infrastructures for digital identity management
     - Key enablers in an increasing digital world (SPID, eIDAS)
     - First line of defense against attackers
