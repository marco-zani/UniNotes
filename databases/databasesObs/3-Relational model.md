# Relational model
it's the most used model thanks to the characteristic to be easier and faster than other models.

#### Definitions
a relational database is a set of relations, which are made of instances, or tables, and schemas, which specifies name of the relation, and name plus type of each column. In the tables, rows equals to the cardinality and are called tuples,the fields are called degrees

## Integrity constraint
A condition must be true for any instance of the database.

Keys can be constraint because no distinct tuples can have the same values
