# Introduction
The management of data this days can be difficult, it varies in volume, velocity, variety... and needs to be processed, stored, transfered... . Handling large scale distributed systems can involves high costs and latency.
So it has been developed a new system to offer services: the Cloud.


A cloud service requires connectivity, reliability, efficiency, scalability, security and a pay-as-you-go system



By definition, cloud computing is a model for enabling on-demand network access to computing resources with

minimal management effort or service provider interaction. The key characteristics are:
- shared resources
- broad network access
- On-demand automated reservation
- rapid elasticity
- Pay by use model



  
### Obstacles

- Availability
- Data lock-in
- Data confidentiality
- Data transfer capability

Cloud services are moved into IoT devices (fog computing) to achieve various achievemt like lower latency, bandwidth costs and improve data privacy and resource ownership. This doesn't come without challenges. One of them is resource orchestration, or
