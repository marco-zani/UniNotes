The management of data this days can be difficult, it varies in volume, velocity, variety... and needs to be processed, stored, transfered... . Handling large scale distributed systems can involves high costs and latency.
So it has been developed a new system to offer services: the Cloud.

# Cloud technology

A cloud service **requires** **connectivity**, **reliability**, **efficiency**, **scalability**, **security** and a **pay-as-you-go** system

#### Model
By definition< cloud computing is a model for enabling **on-demand network access to computing resources with minimal management effort or service provider interaction**. 

#### key characteristics are
- **shared resources**
- **broad network access**
- **On-demand** automated **reservation**
- rapid **elasticity**
- **Pay by use** model
  
#### Obstacles
- **Availability**
- Data **standardization**
- Data **confidentiality**
- Data **transfer capability**

Cloud services are moved into IoT devices (**fog computing**) to achieve various achievemt like **lower latency, bandwidth costs, improved data privacy** and resource ownership. This doesn't come without challenges. One of them is resource orchestration, or

# Datacenters
Datacenters follow the concept of economy of scale. 
The difficulties in management of a datacenter are
- lenghty deployment and procurement
- costly administration, power and disaster recovery
- low utilization

# Cloud management systems
A CMS provides an **abstraction to manage heterogeneous** hypervisors, storage systems and network resources by **providing a distributed OS**
