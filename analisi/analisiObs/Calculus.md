# Cartesian product
The set containing all couples composed by all elements between 2 sets
## Cartesian plane
The Cartesian product generates a plane (or hyperplane for higher dimensions). The Cartesian plane is represented with $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
### points and lines on the plane
With $P_1(x_1,y_1)$ and $P_2(x_2,y_2)$, the line which connects them is defined as $$y-y_0=m(x-x_0)$$ where $m$ is the inclination
# Domains
A function goes from domain to co-domain
## Image
Is the sub-set of the co-domain which contains the function output

> [!tip]- zero product rule
> If $P(x)\cdot Q(x)=0$, then at least one of the two functions equals to zero. With fractions we only consider the numerator

## Sistems
The intersection defines the set of solutions
# Componets
## Parable
The function which describes a parable is $$y=ax^2+bx+c$$The vertex can be found in $\left(\frac{-b}{2a},\frac{-\Delta}{4a}\right)$. The sign of  $\Delta$ describes the direction of the parable (positive goes up, negative goes down). If it's equal to $0$ then the vertex is placed on the axis
## Lines
Given two points, the ratio $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ describes the inclination, represented with $m$, while $q$ is the translation:$$y=mx+q$$
# Functions
## Sequence 
It's a function that goes from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ starting from a given $n$ 
## Function composition
When defining the domain of a composite function we must find a domain wich is always defined
## Graph manipulation
- For horizontal translation: $f(x\pm c)$
- For vertical translation: $f(x)\pm c$
- For horizontal scaling: $f(cx)$
- For vertical scaling: $c\cdot f(x)$
- Mirroring on the $y$ axis: $|f(x)|$
- Mirroring on the $x$ axis: $f(-x)$
- Mirroring only negative values: $f(|x|)$
## Subjective, injective ad bijective functions
