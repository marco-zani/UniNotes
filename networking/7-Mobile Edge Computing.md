Advantages:
- low latency
- enhanced security and privacy (distributed data)
- lower bandwidth
- automation

# Architecture
- a mobile edge host managing virtualization and edge applications
- host level MEC manager
- system level MEC manager
- UE and networks
# 5G MEC functions

## Potential 5g MEC implementations
- Have a specific User Plane Function connecting to a isolated Local Area Data Network (Isolated and local MEC)
- The UPF redirects data either through through another local UPF to the local MEC  or the data network
- Single UPF connecting to both MEC and Data network
