Virtualization and slicing bring flexibility to the network, but also complexity and increased costs, to counter act this behavior, automation is necessary

A fully automated network and services are called zero-touch network

# Automation examples
- fault mitigation
- on-demand network slices
- power efficiency
- flow control

# Zero touch closed loop
1. Define a policy to describe the requested network
2. pass the policy to an orchestrator that manages the network
3. the controller automatically modifies the implemented network to respect the orchestrator commands
4. The network logs are collected in big data storage, which are then used by machine learning to propose modifications to the policy, restarting the loop and leading to improved performance

## Intent-based networking automation
Is the concept of using human intent to close the loop after an operation outcome
