# Organizations
- 3GPP is an union of communication standards organizations which defines 5G
	- Finally is all approved by the International Telecomunication Union
# 5G System (5GS)
composed of:
- Access Network (5G-AN)
- Core Network (5GC)
- User Equipment (UE)

The architecture is service based: Every element is defined as a network function accessible through a common framework
## Radio spectrum
Uses 3 levels of frequencies: low, medium and high
Lower the frequency, lower is the throughput and bigger the coverage. Higher leads to more local and capable networks

## New Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN)
Is the radio access for 5G and provides both for NR (5G) and LTE (4G). this is done through **gNB (5G antenna)** and ng-eNB (4G antenna **capable to communicate** with gNB using the **Xn interface**)
### RAN splitting
gNB (5G antennas) are divided in central and distributed units (CUs and DUs) 
#### Open Radio Access Network ORAN
Divides the units in radio unit and edge unit, capable of splitting the layer roles. The suggested role is the high layer split, which assings layer 2 high and layer 3 to the edge unit, while lower layers are assigned to the radio unit

## Core Architecture model
The interactions between network functions (NFV and SDN) use two types of representations:
- Service based: NF (network functions) withing the CP (control plane) enable other NF to access their services
- Reference point: Shows interactions between NFs in point to point manner
Key principles:
- Separation of control and user plane for easier scaling
- modularization for efficient network slicing
- refactor procedures as services for easier re-use
- Directly interface different network functions
- supporting unified auth framework, stateless network functions, capability exposure, concurrent access and roaming

## API model
The Common API Framework (CAPIF) uses restful APIs also for Service Based Interfaces (SBIs)
### Network Function services
Every NFs must be selfcontained and reusable. They follow a producer and consumer mechanism implementing two behaviours:
- request-response: One produces a service which is requested by another NF
- Subscribe-Notify: A consumer applies to a producer which will send data back without a explicit request, when data is available
	- This can also be transitive where Consumer A subscribes to producer B which notifies consumer C
### NF service discovery
It allowes a Core Network (CN) NF to discover instances of NF that provide the expected service

### NF operations
#### User Plane Function (UPF)
manages:
- packet routing and inspection
- User plane part of policy enforcement
- lawful intercept
- traffic usage reporting
- Quality of service handling
- ARP proxying
#### Session Management Function (SMF)
There can be multiple SMFs for each network slice. It manages:
- session establishment, modify and release
- Ip address allocation
- ARP proxying
- selection and control of UP function, like ARP proxying
- termination of interfaces and lawful intercept 
- configures traffic steering at UPF and roaming
- policies functionalities
#### Access and mobility Management Function (AMF)
Assembles all functions related to User Equipment ( #EU s), like:
- Termination of a #RAN #CP interface
- registration, connection and reachability
- provide connectivity between #EU and #SMF
- Location Services Management
- #UE mobility event notification
It also manages functionalities for interfacing with non 3GPP networks like interfacing, signalling, authentication 

#### Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF)
Supports:
- Select the network slice instances serving a #UE
- Determining the Allowed and configured #NSSAI (Network Slice Selection Assistance Information)
- Determine the #AMF to serve the #UE
