> **Programming**:  (program, data) -> result
> **ML**: (result, data) -> program


>The **idea** is to **develop a model** by letting algoritms learn and infer data


ML is **used when** we **lack human expertise or explaination**, need **personalized models** or when managing **huge** amounts of **data**

The **goal** is to **develop pattern recognition** and apply it to **predict future data**

Generally, a **task** is defined by the **triplet <Task, Perfomance, Experience>** or <Objective, Result quality, Data>
